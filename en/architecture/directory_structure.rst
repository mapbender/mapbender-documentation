Directory structure in Mapbender
################################

application
***********

This directory contains the default Mapbender application. Some important subdirectories and files are:

* the :ref:`config<en/architecture/directory_structure:config>` directory,
* the application kernel (`src/Kernel.php`) as entry point to the Symfony application,
* the Autoloading (`vendor/autoload.php`), auto-generated by Composer,
* the command line applications for maintaining and management tasks (``bin/console``, ``bin/phpunit``) and
* *.env* and *.env.local*: Global configuration files, e.g. for database urls and smtp server connection.

bin
===

Here you find some libraries.

config
======

Basic configuration files of Mapbender are placed in the `config/` directory and the `config/packages` directory. These files are of particular importance:

* :ref:`doctrine.yaml<en/customization/yaml:doctrine.yaml>`
* :ref:`parameters.yaml<en/customization/yaml:parameters.yaml>`
* *services.yaml*: Serves as entry point to configure services.

config/applications
-------------------

The directory `config/applications` contains all applications that are defined in a YAML file. 

Find more information in :ref:`yaml` .

mapbender
=========

* Directory of the `Mapbender submodule <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender>`_. Provides the Mapbender-specific bundles and the Mapbender code.
* Directory for application resources (`Resources/`)

mapbender/...../translations
----------------------------

The translations are stored in `YAML files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_. Every language needs a YAML-file, like *messages.fr.yaml* for the French translation of Mapbender.

* Directory path: `../mapbender/src/Mapbender/CoreBundle/Resources/translations/`

public
======

This directory has to be published by the webserver. The DocumentRoot directive has to refer to this directory. 

It controls: 

* *index.php*: The FrontendController (PHP script which can be called). Uses the environment defined in *.env* or *.env.local*.
* *index_dev.php*: Always uses the dev environment. Per default, access is only allowed from local hosts.
* `public/` also contains the static resoures like css, js, favicon etc.


public/bundles
--------------

* Is the storage for the static resources of the single bundles.
* The following command copies the resources from the bundles to the folder: 

.. code-block:: yaml

     bin/console assets:install --symlink --relative public

.. note:: If you use Windows, you cannot create symbolic links and therefore have to run the command ``php.exe bin/console assets:install public`` to copy the files to the directory after every change in the code.


src
===

Directory for application specific code and resources.

* The application kernel (`src/Kernel.php`) is called by the FrontendControllers and controls the whole application.

var
===

This directory contains:

* the caches (`var/cache/dev` and `var/cache/prod`),
* the logs (`var/log`),
* Sqlite-databases (`var/db/`).

vendor
======

Directory for external libraries (loaded by Composer) are placed here. Resources are used by Symfony using Autoloading:

* Autoloading: *autoload.php*
