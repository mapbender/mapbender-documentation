Access Control Lists
====================

The security for domain objects is implemented in Mapbender using Access Control Lists. ACLs provide flexible permissions for individual objects like applications, services or user- and group management.

Mapbender offers these rights to create individual permissions and secure the domain objects:

- View       : View an existing object
- Create     : Create a new object
- Edit       : Edit an existing object
- Delete     : Delete an existing object
- Operator   : View, Edit, and Delete permission.
- Master     : Operator permission, can manage all permissions up to operator level.
- Owner      : Master permission, can grant master permission as well.
