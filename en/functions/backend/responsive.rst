Responsive Design
*****************

Mapbender offers a responsive design for greater usability. Every element in the toolbar and sidepane can be individually configured to appear for desktop and/or mobile resolutions.

It is also possible to define templates for whole layout sections. This way, all associated elements will be automatically invisible when entering the respective view mode.

Example
=======

In the following example, the FeatureInfo element is removed from the mobile view.

     :scale: 80

The desktop view still displays the element in the toolbar.

However, the element is no longer visible in the mobile view.
