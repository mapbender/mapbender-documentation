Services and their usage in applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

F: I would like to know in which applications a specific WMS service is registered. Is there a way to achive that?

A: Until we provide this information in the Administration Interface, this statement may help you:

.. code-block:: sql

                SELECT mb_core_application.* from mb_core_application, mb_core_layerset, mb_core_sourceinstance, mb_wms_wmsinstance, mb_wms_wmssource, mb_core_source
                where
                -- applications and their layersets
                mb_core_application.id = mb_core_layerset.application_id and
                -- layersets and their instances
                mb_core_layerset.id = mb_core_sourceinstance.layerset and
                -- layerset-instances and wms-instance
                mb_core_sourceinstance.id = mb_wms_wmsinstance.id and
                -- wms-instance and wms-source
                mb_wms_wmsinstance.wmssource = mb_wms_wmssource.id and
                -- wms-source and mb3-core source
                mb_wms_wmssource.id = mb_core_source.id and
                mb_core_source.id = <id_of_the_wms>;


For the ID ``id_of_the_wms`` go to the Data Source page and take the number which is assigned to the specific WMS.


app.php und app_dev.php: What purpose do they have?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please take a look at the `Details of the configuration of Mapbender3 <installation/configuration.html>`_, in chapter `Production- and Development environment and Caching: app.php and app_dev.php <installation/configuration.html#production-and-development-environment-and-caching-app-php-and-app-dev-php>`_.

In general you'll use the app.php file. Only if you develop something (TWIG-files, CSS or JS-files) or for debugging, you'll open Mapbender with the app_dev.php.


What is this cache and when do I have to clear it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Also for this question, please take a look at the `Details of the configuration of Mapbender3 <installation/configuration.html>`_, in chapter `Production- and Development environment and Caching: app.php and app_dev.php <installation/configuration.html#production-and-development-environment-and-caching-app-php-and-app-dev-php>`_.

You'll delete the contents of the ``mapbender/app/cache/`` directory, not the folder itself. In detail the ``prod`` and - if present - the ``dev`` directory.



Performance
-----------

Working with large wms clients
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: During the upload of large wms into an application (e.g. wms with more than 100 layers), the configuration of the `Layerset-Instance <../de/bundles/Mapbender/CoreBundle/entities/layerset.html>`_ only takes and presents an incorrect amount of layers. In addition, the wms instance cannot be saved. Why?

A: To solve the problem, navigate to the php parameter `max-input_vars <http://php.net/manual/de/info.configuration.php#ini.max-input-vars>`_. It defines the number of possible input variables. The default value is 1000 (depending on the php version). In a wms with many layers, the number of input values is higher than the default value. You have to change the parameter to a higher value (e.g. 2000). Notice that the number is directly dependent to the amount of layers in a wms.

.. code-block:: ini

   ;; 1000 (default) or more
   max_input_vars = 1000 



The access to an Oracle database is too slow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: Mapbender seems to have a poor performance while accessing Oracle
databases. I noticed this because queries need more time than usual. Can I accelerate the process?

A: There are two parameters in php.ini which may tweak the performance of Mapbender with Oracle databases: `oci8.max_persistent <http://php.net/manual/de/oci8.configuration.php#ini.oci8.max-persistent>`_ and `oci8.default_prefetch <http://php.net/manual/de/oci8.configuration.php#ini.oci8.default-prefetch>`_. Adjust these parameters to:

.. code-block:: bash

   oci8.max_persistent = 15
   oci8.default_prefetch = 100000

Furthermore, change the respective persistent database connection parameter in config.yml to true.

.. code-block:: bash

   persistent=true


My application cannot be duplicated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Q: I made a highly complex application and want to duplicate it, but it does not work.

A: A possible reason for this is that php does not allow a workflow with big files (YAML-export/import/etc.). The problem occurs especially in FastCGI. Just adjust the php parameter MaxRequestLen (you can do that in the configuration of FCGI).

.. code-block:: bash

   # mod_fcgi.conf (Windows)
   # set value to 2 MB
   MaxRequestLen = 2000000
   
   # fcgid.conf (Linux)
   # set value to 2 MB
   MaxRequestLen 2000000


Simultaneously, you should check the php values in php.ini:

.. code-block:: bash

   max_execution_time = 240
   memory_limit = 1024M
   upload_max_filesize = 2M


Development and manual updates of modules
-----------------------------------------

Q: How can I checkout a specific branch of the Mapbender module and test it? How can I revert this again? Does Composer help me with that?

A: Alternative 1: Go in the directory application/mapbender and checkout the specific branch. After your tests, checkout the original branch again. Do not forget to clear the cache directory (app/cache for Symfony 2, var/cache for the upcoming Symfony 3).

Alternative 2: Change the entry in composer: "mapbender/mapbender": "dev-fix/meinfix" and do a Composer Update. Keep in mind that with that step all other vendor packages will be updated (that's OK for developers). To go back, specify the original branch. In addition go back to application/mapbender and checkout the original branch by hand.


Installation
------------

Attempted to call function "imagecreatefrompng"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

F: I get an error when printing. I have looked into the logfiles (app/logs/prod.log) and found something like this:

.. code-block:: php

                CRITICAL - Uncaught PHP Exception Symfony\Component\Debug\Exception\UndefinedFunctionException:
                "Attempted to call function "imagecreatefrompng"
                from namespace "Mapbender\PrintBundle\Component"."
                at /srv/mapbender-starter/application/mapbender/src/Mapbender/PrintBundle/Component/PrintService.php line 310

A: Please make sure you have installed the php5-gd library.




Deprecation Notices at composer or bootstrap Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

F: I get a deprecation warning when I call bootstrap or composer update:

.. code-block:: php
                
                Deprecation Notice: The callback ComposerBootstrap::checkConfiguration declared at
                /srv//mapbender-starter/application/src/ComposerBootstrap.php accepts a Composer\Script\CommandEvent
                but post-update-cmd events use a Composer\Script\Event instance.
                Please adjust your type hint accordingly, see https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/scripts.md#event-classes
                in phar:///srv/mapbender-starter/composer.phar/src/Composer/EventDispatcher/EventDispatcher.php:290

A: This depends on the PHP version the system in running on and occurs on PHP versions < 7.
