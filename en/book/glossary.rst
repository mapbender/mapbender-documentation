    Twig
        Twig is a templating engine for PHP that is packaged in Symfony2 and offers an easy and powerful way to generate templates. With Twig we can separate the program functionality from design. A Twig file is a simple textfile from which you can generate every text-based format like html or xml.

    XLIFF
        XLIFF is a file format and stands for XML Localization Interchange File Format. The translations can be stored in different formats. We use XLIFF-format for Mapbender3. Symfony will take the XLIFF-loader to load and parse the file.
