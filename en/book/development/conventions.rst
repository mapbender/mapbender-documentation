Conventions for Mapbender3
##########################

Code conventions
*****************

* variable names / way of coding 
* Code documentation
* trans convention - where to put translation


* document the x steps on the way to a new functionality

  * define the topic
  * create a ticket
  * create a workflow

  * documentation in mapbender-documentation --> rst

Git branch conventions
**********************

We follow the Git Flow branching model (Read more about it in the
`original document <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_
describing it). Basically that boils down to having at least two branches:

* develop - for the daily work, always has the latest merged commits, and is
  equal to or ahead of the latest release
* master - only changes on new releases (right now and until the 3.0.1 release,
  some of our repositories don't have a master branch but will get one then
  again)

Furthermore there might be more branches, which must always be namespaced:

* feature/<name> - Used for developing new features (feature/printservice)
* hotfix/<name> - Used for making hot fixes for releases (hotfix/bug_123)
* release/<name> - Used for preparing releases, very short-lived (release/3.0.1)

Some Linux distributions have a package called git-flow which will provide easy
git command shortcuts to use the merge/branch model of Git Flow without having
to do everything by yourself (which is still possible and you should always know
how Git Flow uses plain git to achieve things).


Layout conventions
*******************
What to keep in mind, when you create a layout

* naming conventions
* where to put the css
* where to put the twig
* where to put the images / should be possible to easy switch an image collection an get other buttons


Translation where
************************

* conventions to put the files? Groß-Kleinschreibung/ welche Übersetzungen werden generell gepflegt? en/de weitere?
* also have a look at `Translation in Mapbender3 <../translation.rst>`


Issue conventions
********************
Issues (bugs and features) are administrated in the **mapbender**-repository at:

* https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/issues

We create a milestone for every version of Mapbender3:

*  https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/milestones

There are some rules you should keep in mind:

* **write understandable tickets!!**

* **write your title** so that the issue is already described in the title: 

  * Browser - Backend/Frontend - element - issue 
  * like: Firefox - Frontend - layertree - option visible is not handled in frontend
  * see ticket https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/issues/48
* write **comments** with all necessary information: 
  * for bugs: describe step by step how the error can be reproduced
  * for features: describe feature and functionality
* when you create a new ticket do not assign it to a milestone or developer, if you are not sure

* **add labels** to your ticket 
  * bug - describes a bug that orrurs in a special version of Mapbender3 (add info about the version)
  * feature - new feature
  * enhancement - stands for feature enhancement
  * wip - work in progress

* when you work on a ticket or close it please **assign a user and milestone**

* **when you close a ticket**, please:

  * add a comment in the ticket and **refer to the commit**,
  * refer to the documentation at http://doc.mapbender3.org or a demo if possibile.




Version conventions
*******************
The Mapbender3 version is defined by a four digit numbering system, seperated by dots.

3.0.10.20

* The **first** digit is constant and represents the Mapbender3 software cycle.

* The **second** digit describes all new features and major changes in Mapbender3, with the highest difficulty level of a update process.

* The **third** digit describes new features and minor changes, which can be easily updated.

* The **fourth** digit represents only bugfixes and micro changes.

Increase a digit means always a reset for all digits before. For example - 3.0.10.20 -> 3.1.0.0

This numbering system started with Mapbender3 version 3.0.0.0
