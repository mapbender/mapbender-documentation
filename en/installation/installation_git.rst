Git-based installation
######################

You find an introduction to the installation from the Git-sources in the README.md of the mapbender-starter Git-repository:

`https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/README.md <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/README.md>`_.

We have created a Contributing Guide for developers which describes the necessary steps to develop with Mapbender and also explains how to install the software via Git. This documentation is directly available in the Git-Repository:


`https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.


The Git-based installation is for the development of Mapbender or for project-specific customization that you can save in a cloned mapbender-starter. There you can store your own print templates, your bundles, your templates, CSS or twig and also modified files.
