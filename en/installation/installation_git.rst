Git-based installation
######################

.. note:: The Git-based installation is intended for Mapbender development or project-specific customizations that can be stored in a cloned Mapbender Starter. There, you can add your own printing templates, applications, or bundles. You can then load Mapbender and any other modules you need (e.g., Digitizer) using Composer. When updating Mapbender, compare the status of the Mapbender Starter repositories. The basic customizations can be done by chcecking the versions in the *composer.json* file.

All essential information is documented by the Mapbender team on GitHub. The key documentation files and their contents include:

* `README.md <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/README.md>`_ describes the installation from the Git sources of the Mapbender Starter Git repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`_ lists changes between the different Mapbender versions.
* `Upgrading.MD <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/blob/develop/docs/UPGRADING.md>`_ provides important information on Mapbender installation upgrades to specific versions.
* The `Contributing Guide <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ presents the software architecture and the steps involved in developing Mapbender.
* The `/docs/` `README.MD <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender/blob/develop/docs/README.md>`_ is the entry page for the technical documentation of Mapbender.
