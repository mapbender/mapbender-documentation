Introduction
############

This book is targeted at Mapbender developers and will cover useful topics
not needed by administrators or users of Mapbender installations.

Things you should know
**********************

There are a couple of things you should be familiar with in order to contribute
to Mapbender:

* Object-Orientated PHP: We're using PHP 5.3 which offers full object
  orientation. No simple scripts anymore.
* Symfony: This is what we build upon. So read `The Book
  <https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html>`_ and learn about controllers,
  templating and the other cool things.
* Docblock annotations: We use ApiGen to generate code documentation.
* JavaScript: We use jQuery a lot and especially the jQuery UI widget factory.
  These are essential to understand to write maintainable JavaScript code.
