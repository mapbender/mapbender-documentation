Introduction
############

This book is targeted at Mapbender developers and will cover useful topics not needed by administrators or users of Mapbender installations.


Things to consider
******************

There are a couple of things you should be familiar with in order to contribute to Mapbender:

* Object-Orientated PHP: We're using PHP which offers full object orientation.
* Symfony: This is what we build upon. So read `The Book <https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html>`_ to learn more about Symfony.
* JavaScript: We use jQuery a lot and especially the jQuery UI widget factory. These are essential to understand to write maintainable JavaScript code.


Installation
************

The installation procedure from Git is described under :ref:`installation_git`.


Modules and bundles
*******************

Please refer to the respective sections in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guide to understand what `modules <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#modules>`_ and what `bundles <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bundles>`_ are, and how the latter can be `created <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bundle-creation>`_.


Twig
****

Symfony follows the template approach and we use this in Mapbender. Symfony uses a templating engine to generate HTML, CSS or other content. 
A template is a text file that can generate any text based format like HTML, XML. It is used to express presentation and not programm logic.
You can use them to create a layout. You can create a base layout and then overwrite or append any of your layout blocks with individual templates.
Read more about Templates in Mapbender at :ref:`templates` or in the `Contributing Guide <https://github.com/mapbender/mapbender-starter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#generate-translations>`_ and find a good introduction about Twig in the `Symfony Template documentation <https://symfony.com/doc/current/templates.html>`_.
